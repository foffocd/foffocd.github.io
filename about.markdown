Hello, welcome to the blog. This blog is one of many in the world of blogs, a world full of blogs that have OCD and other blogs that joke about being organised.


### Why
The purpose of the blog is to try to look at OCD from slightly alternative perspectives. I suffer from the disorder and have found that it presents varying challenges depending on the moment. Suffering from OCD is tortuous and it presents unique and strange psychological challenges. I've started to find the manner in which the mind reacts and adapts very interesting. So I thought I would write about it. 


### What FoffOCD is Not
That said the pyschologial mechanics of the condition are well documented and there are many sites defining the disorder, symptoms and how to get treatment - [OCD-UK](http://www.ocduk.org/ "OCD-UK") seems quite complete. 

This blog is not a resource for OCD sufferers seeking help or treatment.


### Terminology
There is lots of established OCD terminology and when I use it I will try to put it in **bold**. However I will make up my own terminology depending on what viewpoint I'm taking.

### Audience

The blog should be useful for two groups:

* OCD sufferers
* Non sufferers who want to understand a bit more about the condition.

### Post Frequency

Aiming for 1 a month, but we'll see what happens!

Thanks for reading, 

Will
