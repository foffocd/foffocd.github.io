Frequently when I am starting a new post I have to stop myself from basing it on a photo I took, but here I just couldn't resist.

I often find myself on beaches in Connemara on the west coast of Ireland. Mainly to walk the dog, and the wife. Recently, on one of these beaches, there was a gale blowing in from the west. Part of the beach is a sandbar separating one bay from another and waves hit both sides. Here's a picture of it on a much calmer day. The feature picture (^) was taken from this sandbar with a gale, looking towards the headland and gale hitting my back.

</div>

So the waves on the east side of the sandbar are _waving into the wind_, with the top of the wave caught by the wind and sprayed backwards. That's what is happening in the feature picture. I didn't know what the analogy would be, but I grabbed the camera from wife and snaparoo.

The wave got me thinking about resisting thoughts and a problem that I had when I first started practicing Mindfulness. It appeared to me like the methods of mindfulness and CBT contradicted each other. So in this post I'll try to use an analogy to describe this problem and how it was resolved.

# Mind ~ Ocean
I have no doubt it has been said before - the mind is like the ocean.

The formation of waves is complicated. Check out the [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wind_wave) page (I just skimmed it). Roughly speaking, most waves are formed when sustained winds blow over open water. Energy is transferred from the wind to the water. The waves then propagate until they hit land. So most waves that you see in the ocean are formed by winds that are far away and may have even stopped blowing. It seems that in general the local wind can only form ripples and does not have much influence.

So I started thinking about my mind as an ocean. When I'm on the beach I can see waves coming towards me that I have no control over. I don't know how these waves were created. I must have created them, somewhere deep in my mind, a wind far far away and they have patiently propagated.

</div>

They will break on the beach right in front of me. I can't do anything about it except hear the crash and then the fizz as they retreat.

# Resisting Thoughts
I can see a big wave coming, it feels like I never created it, maybe it's the wake from a ship. It's dark and steep, pushing through the other waves, staring at me, coming to get me. It's like an awful thought I never want to accept, the closer it comes the darker it gets. There is nothing I can do.

</div>

Wait! What about the local wind, a wind I can control. Something else created this wave but maybe I can stop it. So I whip up the local wind, turning a breeze into a gale. I'll send this wave propagating back to where it came from.

	<img src="/img/wavingintothewind/gale.png" alt="gale"  />
</div>

But it's futile. The local wind I created can only catch the top of the wave, causing it to spray backwards (like in the feature pic!). This blocks my view of the rest of my ocean and even worse there's a gale blowing around me. The wave crashes just like before with the same fizzing retreat.


# Dodgy Analogy
OK so maybe it isn't the tightest of analogies. I hope it's clear that:

* Waves are your thoughts and most of them are formed, automatically, deep in your mind. When they break you are actually thinking them. The process that created these thoughts, again automatically, is the distant wind.
* The local wind is controlled manually and is the one thing you have control over. The problem is it isn't very powerful.
* The big dark wave is an **intrusive thought**. It wasn't created by you. You try to resist the intrusive thought by using the local wind, but it just makes everything worse.

# OCD, Mindfulness and CBT
Let's put this analogy aside for a little while and talk about Mindfulness and CBT. I have been meditating (or practicing mindfulness, whatever you want to call it) for 10 minutes most days for about a year. I use [Headspace](www.headspace.com). In general I have found meditating very useful. I find I am able to think clearer and I am able to recall events more often because my concentration is improved. But the main reason I started meditating was because of OCD and at the beginning this wasn't so successful.

The basic pattern of meditation (well the _Headspace_ flavour at least, which is all I know) is:

1. Notice when you become distracted by thought. Accept that this is OK.
2. _Gently_ redirect your attention back to what you are doing.
3. Repeat.

The idea is that noticing you are distracted and then redirecting your thoughts makes it easier to notice you are distracted, and also, easier to redirect your thoughts. Virtuous Cycle! 

My problem was the redirecting bit. This seemed to contradict everything I had learned from Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT). The basic pattern of CBT (at least how I learned it!) is:

1. Intrusive thoughts happen all the time. You have no control over it and that is perfectly OK.
2. When an intrusive thought occurs _do not_ suppress it or try to resist it. Accept it and let yourself feel anxious. The anxiety _will_ go away.

My problem was that point 2 for mindfulness seems to contradict point 2 for CBT. I was very confused.

# Apples and Oranges, for me

My confusion was resolved by a realisation. Mindfulness and CBT attack OCD in two different ways. It is not reasonable to compare them. I must explicitly assert here that this is a personal discovery - I do not know if this generalises.

By practicing mindfulness I have found that I have a little bit more control of how I think. I have a better chance of avoiding useless thinking, because when I spot it I can nip it in the bud. I have found that a lot of intrusive thoughts come from useless thinking. For me, less useless thinking means less intrusive thoughts.

However, I accept that nothing can completely guard me from intrusive thoughts. (This is like the fundamental theorem of having OCD. *Intrusive thoughts are inevitable!*) For me, this is where CBT helps. It helps me normalize intrusive thoughts. This is done by *not* resisting or blocking them and trusting that the anxiety will go away once your brain inevitably figures out that intrusive thoughts aren't real.

Returning to the ocean analogy: Mindfulness helps me calm the ocean. But when rogue waves do occur, CBT helps me to laugh at them.

# Headspace

Finally, I should say that I've found [Headspace](www.headspace.com) has made Mindfulness really accessible to me. It also has some slick animations including this Mindfulness analogy.
