Sometimes I find a feature picture and then start to write a post around it. Not exactly a content first method and zero of these have been posted...until now.

I find myself on beaches in Galway a lot. Mainly to walk the dog, and the wife. Recently, on one of these beaches, there was a gale blowing in from the west. Part of the beach is a sandbar separating one bay from another with waves hitting on both sides. The waves on the east side of the sandbar are _waving into the wind_, with the top of the wave caught by the wind and sprayed backwards.

I didn't know what the metaphor would be yet, but I grabbed the camera from wife and snap.

# Waves ~ Thoughts
The formation of waves in water is [complicated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wind_wave). But roughly speaking they form when sustained winds blow over open water. The waves you see in the ocean are not formed by the local wind but rather winds that are faraway. From our point of view it's like they appear from nowhere. The waves will crash on our beach, there is nothing we can do about it.
